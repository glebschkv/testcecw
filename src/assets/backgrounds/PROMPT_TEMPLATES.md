# Pixel Art Background Prompts - Production Ready

Each prompt is complete and standalone. Copy and paste directly.

CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL PROMPTS:
- CHUNKY VISIBLE PIXELS - you should clearly see the pixel grid
- NO FACES on sun, moon, clouds, or any objects
- Ground has IRREGULAR GRASS/TEXTURE EDGE - helps hide sprite height differences
- NATURAL EARTHY colors with color accents - like Chrono Trigger or Stardew Valley, NOT candy-colored
