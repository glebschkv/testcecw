## MEADOW

```
2D pixel art game background, retro platformer, 1920x1080, 16:9,

pure side view with zero depth, the entire image is flat like a painted backdrop with no 3D elements whatsoever, no front-facing surfaces, no ledges, no platforms sticking out toward the viewer,

COMPOSITION: the bottom 25 percent is a flat green grass field that extends horizontally from edge to edge as a simple color block, the grass meets the sky at one clean horizontal line with no dirt edge no cross-section no visible ground thickness, just grass color above and that is it,

ABOVE THE GRASS LINE: large oak tree on the left as a flat 2D shape, distant blue-green hills as horizontal color bands, blue sky, white pixel clouds, yellow sun, small birds,

STYLE: 8-bit or 16-bit pixel art, flat colors only, no shading gradients, visible chunky pixels, hard edges, limited palette, looks like classic NES or SNES game background, every element is a flat 2D shape with no volume or depth,

AVOID: any 3D depth, ground cross-sections, dirt layers, platform edges, ledges, front-facing surfaces, thickness on any element, gradients, anti-aliasing, realistic lighting, animals on the ground, characters
