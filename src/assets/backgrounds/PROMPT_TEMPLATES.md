## Tips for Best Results

1. **Resolution**: Always specify 1920x1080 or your target resolution
2. **Flat perspective**: Emphasize "no vanishing point" and "parallel ground plane"
3. **Ground placement**: "ground perfectly horizontal at bottom third" ensures consistent placement
4. **Tileable**: Add "seamless tileable horizontally" for repeating backgrounds
5. **Color palette**: Providing specific hex codes helps maintain consistency
6. **Layer separation**: Defining foreground/middle/background creates depth without perspective
7. **Style consistency**: Always include "16-bit", "crisp pixel edges", "no anti-aliasing"
